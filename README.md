# Rain-Prediction
Weather forecasting has been in existence since 1835.
But, modern forecasting methods using sensors and
physical techniques demands a lot of resources. In 2009,
the US spent approximately $5.1 billion on weather
forecasting. Hence, our aim is to cut this cost by training a
Machine learning model that will use the previous day’s
data to predict tomorrow’s downpour with appreciable
accuracy.

# Data used
Observations were drawn from numerous weather stations. The daily observations are available from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data.
Data source: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/ and http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data.
