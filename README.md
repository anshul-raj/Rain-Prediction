# Rain-Prediction
Weather forecasting has been in existence since 1835.
But, modern forecasting methods using sensors and
physical techniques demands a lot of resources. In 2009,
the US spent approximately $5.1 billion on weather
forecasting. Hence, our aim is to cut this cost by training a
Machine learning model that will use the previous day’s
data to predict tomorrow’s downpour with appreciable
accuracy.
